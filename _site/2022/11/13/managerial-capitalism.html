It is a highly ordered, system with a well defined set of rules on how to excel. Success is measured only by financial success. The average intelligence person who receives the sufficient support will achieve this success by following a limited number of pre-packaged careers: banking, management consulting, financial analysis or auditing. This set of rules is only known to an elite sub-section of society, and there is an elaborate argument made about the utility of these careers that provide a defense for the status quo. We, the west, live in a low-innovation equilibrium state where oligarchic monopolistic companies dominate the economy and have achieved regulatory capture.</p><p>The key characteristic of the managerial society which contrasts with the bourgeois capitalism of the past is that organizations are no longer owned by the people who operate them. The transition of America from a ‘bourgeois-‘, to a ‘managerial-‘ society was analysed in <a href="/assets/2022-11-13-managerial-capitalism_pdf_1.pdf">James Burnham - ‘The Managerial Revolution: What is Happening in the World’</a>. We have gone from maker’s to managers’ world and yet, inequality has been rising in the USA since 1971.</p><p>The podcast <a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/290-what-went-wrong">Sam Harris - Making Sense #290 - What Went Wrong? - A Conversation with Marc Andreessen</a> from July 21, 2022 presents an excellent summary of the situation.</p><blockquote><p>The term professional–managerial class (PMC) refers to a social class within capitalism that, by controlling production processes through occupying a superior management position, is neither proletarian nor bourgeois</p><p>Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1520581769342332929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2022</a></p></blockquote><p>Marc Andreessen is skeptical of Piketty’s thesis is that returns to capital are significantly greater than returns to labor. But where they agree is on the excessive financialization of everything. But rather than concluding that the problem is capitalism itself, Andreessen asks ‘do we actually live in a capitalist market economy or a managed oligopolistic economy that is intertwined with the government?’. The economy is dominated by sector after sector of old-line, fortune 500 monopolistic entities that are nominally private companies but in reality they have achieved regulatory capture. Every now or then we’ll get an Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, but we are largely insulated from innovating technologists.</p><p>There are two contrasting policies which encapsulate the problem: in 1970, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) was founded to regulate all pollution. And in 1973, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Independence">Project Independence</a> was launched, which like the French aimed at total energy independence by the year 2000. It surveyed all the available tech and concluded that nuclear was the answer. These are <em>equally</em> important projects but the regulation progressed without problems but no nuclear power was delivered.</p><p>We live in a society where only the ‘seen’ is taken into account. The ‘unseen’, that is the costs from <em>not</em> taking action are not effectively appraised. The same can be said of the lack of COVID challenge trials. Our governments are incapable of taking calculated risk. But in the additional 6-9 months, when we waited for the double blind trials to complete, millions vaccine-preventable deaths occurred. The one good thing is work injuries are down.</p><p>53:00:</p><blockquote><p>Marc: “When you have a startup today, an Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, or me, we represent a rump-return of bourgeois capitalism. Amazon was a bourgeoise capitalist exercise which is now being absorbed into the managerial oligarchy. The new CEO is a large owner or a founder. The reason startups and venture capital exists is because managerial capitalism is very good at administering large scale monopolies and oligopolies over a long period of time, but is very bad at doing anything new. The is no managerial team at any big company or any big government organization that wakes up in the morning that says “Hey, I know, I’m gonna do some crazy new thing. And if it succeeds we’re gonna be heroes and if it fails we’re probably all gonna get fired. They never do that”.”</p><p>Sam: “So the is the problem in the principle agent problem is the misalignment of incentives?”</p><p>Marc: “Exactly, 100%. If you are a Fortune 500 CEO, you’re going to make 50 million dollars a year as long as you don’t get fired. A number one priority for you in your life is; « I’m going to hold on to this job for as long as I possibly can ». And every year that goes by is 50 million bucks in the bank, generational wealth for my family for 1000 generations to come. Don’t get fired, Don’t get fired, Don’t get fired. So how do you go about not getting fired; don’t change anything, don’t do anything, take no risk, do not go out on a limb, do not try new things, don’t try and do new new things. Don’t do anything that is going to perturb. I have a CEO friend whose colloquialism is;; you don’t fuck with the magic. Its working; you just don’ not break it. This is what they teach a Stanford business school and Harvard Business School: you run it, by managing. They call it management school for a reason. You manage it, you run it. You do not break it, you don’t take risk. So as a consequence they don’t make new things. So as a consequence, the arbitrage opportunity, the ability to make money by making new things falls on your Jeff Bezos, your Elon Musk, the people we fund and back to start new companies in the model of the previous form of capitalism which was bourgeois capitalism. But we are a rounding error on the system. If you total up all venture capital and all privately backed tech companies and by the way, tally the number of companies in the fortune 500 that are still run by their founders, its like 6. So the old model of capitalism keeps coming back because you can make money doing it because its its the only way you can do new things. But managerial capitalism runs the economy. And managerial capitalism broadly runs the the system, the state that we live under. It spans the fortune 500, the big companies, the government bureaucracies, the press, the universities, its a classical oligarchic class. They are all agents, they’re zero-principles. Nobody is in charge, no body has the power, nobody has accountability, no body has any of this stuff and they do what they do and we expect this system to do things differently and do things they used to do in the old days. Like for example, why don’t we have any new cities. Where are the new bridges, the new freeways, the new reactors, the factories for PPE for COVID, the new chip plants. And then we wake up 50 years into this and we’re like we don’t have any of those things, we can’t do any of those things any more. And this is my big conclusion. This is the system we designed and we wanted it. Its weird because its like a shadow. Its not the constitution as its written, its some other thing, but whatever, but whatever it is its obviously much more important. As far as I can tell we’ll just keep running like this in perpetuity and see what happens.</p><p>Sam: “It sounds like lurking in there is some nostalgia for something like autocracy because the difference capitalism is all these extra people who don’t have enough skin in the game to error correct and be motivated appropriately by the mass of opportunities, and what you want to be able to pivot back to is the founder led version where is essentially North Korea where the guy with bad hair at the top can decide everything “</p><p>Marc: “Lets go to founding of the city of Los Angeles”</p><p>…Literally what they did was take out ads with drawings of the garden paradise of los angeles.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We chose to go from a sort of bourgeois culture. An aristocratic talent selection process, sort of this world of power pre cold war and then cold war thing where we decided to develop the country and build all these things and then in 1960s and 1970s, we decided we didn’t want that anymore and we decided we wanted an oligarchy instead of an aristocracy and we decied we wanted managerial capitalism instead of bourgeois captialism and we decied we wanted lawyers in charge of everything and we</p></blockquote><h2 id="the-pretense">The Pretense</h2><p>There are a number seemingly benevolent systems and institutions who ostensibly exist for some (often tautological) reason, but really exist to provide a shield or veneer of legitimacy to some other less savory systems and institutions. Note the reoccurring theme of ‘ostensible-‘ rather than ‘actual-‘ reasons-for-existing.</p><p>The widening gulf between rich and poor and compounded with a weakening ability of these dual-purpose organisations to keep the public credulous (where that public has a growing availability of de-centralised, grass-root information sources) is resulting in unprecedented levels of both distrust of institutions and class-resentments.</p><p>But in the same way that the regulatory gate-keepers of managerial-capitalism de-legitimise new technological solutions that could challenge the economic status-quo, the intellectual authorities (mainstream media and Universities) are not interested in describing the situation using a model that represents present reality because that would challenge the very context in which they exist. Mainstream news organisations like the guardian and the NYC, have patently aligned partisan agendas. And higher education is one of a number of industries, now administration-dominated, due to managerial capitalism.</p><p>A devils advocate line of questioning might be: _“You suggest there is a lack of social and political theoretical innovation, but we have seem sweeping changes in behavior in favor of social justice movements.”</p><p>Progressivist identity politics has arisen whilst economically left wing an that now controls the norms of polite society currently causing deep changes to behavioral norms and institutional practices. To name a few: MeToo, Trans-Rights and BLM sweep western world. But the lack of economic relevance of these movements is precisely the reason for their success. Notice that the ‘social-progress’ has been limited social identity groups: sex, gender-identity, sexuality, race, abled-ness and, (a certain) religion. It costs very little for a corporation to create arbitrary rules on identity, especially when their revenue is related more to their ability to maintain regulatory control than deliver effective market competition.</p><p><img src="/assets/2022-11-13-managerial-capitalism-image-1.png" alt="" /></p><p>The result is, that we are still stuck with 18th, 19th and early 20th century political terms like left-right, communist-fascist. And in the same way that the terms ‘safety’ and ‘quality’ are used to clobber any technical innovation, the terms ‘sexist, racist and fascist’ are used to clobber any ideological innovation. Our cultural imperative of tolerance and human rights, born after the allied victory in WW2 has become a peerless political weapon.</p><p>But this weapon has been wielded all too liberally in recent years. The freehandedness with which these virtue signaling accusations are dolled out is one thing, but often those dealing them cannot pretend to have even shred of integrity themselves. And the patent triviality of these word games contrast gravely with the consequences the victims have to bare. Our worst taboos are tripwires to every comment we make on a difficult issue and the result is a conversational status quo, with ever increasing puritanical controls. The word game has also become a total farce to everyone involved, a theatre without any meaning beyond itself. Was it ever thus? No, and even if it were, it needs to be urgently reformed.</p><blockquote><p>Fires will be kindled to testify that two and two make four. Swords will be drawn to prove that leaves are green in summer. We shall be left defending, not only the incredible virtues and sanities of human life, but something more incredible still, this huge impossible universe which stares us in the face. (G.K. Chesterton, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1884008">Heretics</a>, first published 1905)</p></blockquote><p>Almost everything is about signaling and prestige, almost nothing is about figuring out reality, hence, for example, why media coverage of politics seems to be deranged and surreal to those who are the objects of the coverage. Paul Graham: the media constantly spreads false memes about startups and success.</p><ul><li></li></ul><span class="meta"><time datetime="2022-11-13T00:00:00+01:00">November 13, 2022</time> &middot; </span></section></main></body></html>
